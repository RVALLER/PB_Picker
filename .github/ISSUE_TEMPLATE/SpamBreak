A bug occurs when spamming the generate winning numbers button

How to Dupe:

i. Launch Program
ii. Spam Generate Winning Numbers
iii. Chaos
iv. 'None' appears frquently in subsequent winning # generations


Theories: List generation for 'used numbers' gets broken at spam
          alternatively, it sees future generations as same entity as prior ones and does not allow
          for 'repeat' numbers

Desired Behavior: Clicking simulations as much as possible SHOULD result separate functional simulations

Solution in meantime: Relaunch program

Proposed Fix: Deal with the simulation of launching by allowing repeat in separate simulations.
  Approach to fix: Unsure at current time.
