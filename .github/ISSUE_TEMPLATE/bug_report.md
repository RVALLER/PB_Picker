**Describe the bug**
Occassionally generating numbers be it single or all at once will leave numbers displaced or non-existent at all.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Launch Program
2. Click on Generate Winning Numbers
3. Enjoy the show
4. See error

**Expected behavior**
Balls will do the expected canvas movement animation, stop and produce a number
cenetered on the ball as soon as it stops

**Screenshots**
N/A

**Additional context**
Might have to do with the animation functions in the code since the generate single button was added
